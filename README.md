# Blue-Green Deployment with Kubernetes

## Description

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a blue-green deployment strategy using Kubernetes. The goal is to achieve zero-downtime deployment of a sample application by seamlessly routing traffic between two identical environments, referred to as "blue" and "green".

## Technologies

- Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for managing and scaling containerized applications.
- Docker: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- Nginx: Used for traffic routing and load balancing between the blue and green environments.

## Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment

In a blue-green deployment, there are two identical environments: blue (the current production environment) and green (the new environment with the updated application). 

1. **Blue Environment**: Initially, all traffic is routed to the blue environment, where the current version of the application is running.
   
2. **Green Environment**: The new version of the application is deployed to the green environment without affecting the blue environment.
   
3. **Traffic Switch**: Once the green environment is successfully deployed and tested, traffic is gradually switched from the blue to the green environment.
   
4. **Rollback**: If any issues are encountered during the deployment, traffic can be immediately reverted back to the blue environment.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster set up and configured.
- Docker installed locally for building container images.
- Nginx ingress controller configured for traffic routing.

### Steps

1. **Deploy Blue Environment**: Deploy the initial version of the application to the blue environment in Kubernetes.
   
2. **Deploy Green Environment**: Build and deploy the updated version of the application to the green environment in Kubernetes.
   
3. **Route Traffic**: Configure Nginx for traffic routing, directing a portion of traffic to the green environment while keeping the majority on the blue environment.
   
4. **Gradual Switch**: Monitor the performance of the green environment. If successful, gradually increase the traffic directed to the green environment and decrease traffic to the blue environment.
   
5. **Rollback (if necessary)**: In case of any issues or unexpected behavior, immediately switch all traffic back to the blue environment while investigating and resolving the issue.

## Usage

Provide detailed instructions on how to deploy and use the blue-green deployment strategy using Kubernetes, Docker, and Nginx.


## Conclusion

Implementing a blue-green deployment strategy with Kubernetes, Docker, and Nginx enables seamless deployment of applications with zero downtime. By maintaining two identical environments and gradually switching traffic, this strategy minimizes the risk of disruption and provides a reliable method for deploying updates or new features.
